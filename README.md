Back in 2018, I traveled to the National Harbor in Washington D.C. to meet up with some friends who were attending Magfest, a convention that [touts] a weekend celebration of video games, video game music and the surrounding culture. In reality, it was just another sausage fest filled with nerds who didn’t bring enough deodorant.
I had initially gone because I was talking to someone on Tinder at the time, and we had agreed to meet up at the convention. It turns out my friends knew this person of interest and advised me to not meet with them. In turn, much of my time was spent between drinking with my friends and playing pinball in the arcade hall that stayed open all night.
I am grateful of my friends’ advice because if I did spend the night with my Tinder date, I would have missed out on the renaissance painting that was my friends splayed across the hotel room floor, throwing up everywhere as the only sober friend struggled to keep everyone proper. On the other hand, I am disappointed in them because I had to spend the night in a hotel room that stank of vomit.
After stealing towels from the hotel’s pool to offset the slimy mess that was my friends, I gave up on sleeping through the smell and retreated back to the arcade hall where I played pinball for the rest of the night. It felt like a fever dream.
Being at Magfest, I was already surrounded by the dregs of society; however, it was even more so the case past 2 a.m. Those who couldn’t find a place to stay or were too drunk to operate roamed the convention halls in a tired stupor. I would like to say that my circumstances were different, but it’s not like it mattered to the hotel staff who were tasked with prodding awake those who fell asleep in the lobby.
*These conventions are already cesspools of germs, drugs and the very rare occasion of sex. I can only imagine how big a super-spreader event one would be during the pandemic. Then again, these conventions are probably the only time people leave their rooms. Which is a direct contradiction to my friends the morning after their drunken fiasco.
While I was excited to get my monies worth on the convention pass that cost near $100, my friends directed their hung-over anger towards the idea of getting out of bed. After seeing what the previous night entailed, I didn’t blame them.
